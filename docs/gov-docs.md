# Governance Docs

Documents that *describe* policy go in the [handbook](./README.md). Documents that *define* policy go the the [gov docs]([https://github.com/dsausa/gov-docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q02NXa22YlZ1GMreLVUoPgKIliu21DtT?usp=share_link))

How do you make changes to the gov docs? Read the official policy in full here: [https://github.com/dsausa/gov-docs/blob/main/governance-process-definition-policy.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ySg1Apj9KHTbXaIyA_F4pqEPRSM6u_qS1GCf97LwvA/edit?usp=sharing)

But in short:
1. NTC member creates a merge request with the changes they want made.
2. 7 days for members to review. At least 2 expressions of support (either a thumbs up or a comment to the merge request)
3. SC votes on it async or at a meeting

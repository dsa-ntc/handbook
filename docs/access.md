# Access

You will need access to several applications to do stuff in the NTC. When you first join you will need get access to these resources. You should ask your team steward for access and ping #ask-steering for help. Steering is ultimately in charge of administrating all access control permissions.

## Google Groups
Everyone needs access to this, as it is how we administrate gDrive and mailing list access and permissions. You will probably only need a member permission.

The NTC list serv is: ntc-members@dsacommittees.org

Your individual team should have a sub-group under that org for administrating your gDrive stuff.

## Github
There are two Github orgs:
- [DSA USA administrated by the DSA national org](https://github.com/dsausa). Access to this more limited.
- [DSA NTC](https://github.com/dsa-ntc). Administrated by the NTC. You will probably be given access to a repo in this repo.

If you are given access to a project repo that is NOT in one of these orgs please message #ask-steering or #c-vitalization to get the issue sorted. We are trying to avoid further fracturing our code repositories.

## Wordpress
You will only be given WP access if you actively working on a WP project or as a contributor or editor. See your team steward about getting access.

## Figma
You'll be given access to this by your steward as needed.

## Sentry.io
You'll be given access to this by your steward as needed.

## Digital Oceans
You'll be given access to this by your steward as needed.

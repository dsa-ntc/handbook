Reporting to the NTC Steering Committee, the Secretariat is an organizing body responsible for mobilizing NTC Members and directing available labor into our prioritized projects. When the SC elects to prioritize work within the NTC, the Secretariat mobilizes members to complete the work. It is composed of:

#### Commissions:
Groups convened to complete a specific, scoped task. Examples here may be a major software or feature launch or a security guide for DSA membership.

#### Departments:
 Long-term bodies responsible for the ongoing maintenance of projects without an end. The *Membership department* is responsible for mobilizing members and directing them to work - a project without end. In some cases at the completion of a commission's work ongoing project maintenance may be rolled into a department.

Commissions and departments are chartered and approved by the steering committee, working with the secretariat, based on available resources and alignment with the priorities of the organization. See the [charter template](charter-template-for-new-commissions-and-departments) for more information.

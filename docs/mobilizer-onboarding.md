# NTC Onboarding and Mobilization

1. Assign yourself a person on the Outreach Log

   2. How to Use: Fill out your name under the “Mobilizer” column. Check off the “Contacted” column once you have emailed the person. Fill out the “1-on-1 date” column once your initial meeting has been completed. Check off the “Placed” column once you have introduced the person to their new steward (as described in step 7).
   3. If a person ever falls off the mobilization process, either by not responding to outreach or by letting you know they can no longer commit to the NTC, mark off in the “Reengage Applicant” column either No Response or Formerly Involved. You can elaborate in the “Follow-up Notes” column.
   4. Other columns: We no longer use the “Designation” column (it was previously used for vetting), but you can mark it as “Speak”. We also no longer use the “Secretariat” column, but you can check it off at the same time as the “Slack” column. Hover on the column names for other explanations.
2. Send an outreach email to the person

   1. Introduce yourself as a mobilizer for the DSA NTC. Ask to set up a quick (~30 minute) meeting and provide them with a link to schedule one with you. There is an email template at the bottom of this document.
   2. cal.com is the scheduling site we currently use, but you may have another you prefer.
3. Wait for a response and verify the date of the meeting

   1. Depending on your preferred scheduling software you may need to follow up with a video link. If using cal.com, you can integrate scheduling with Google Calendar and Google Meet.
   2. If the person doesn’t respond, you may send a follow-up email in a couple of weeks. If they continue to be unresponsive, you may mark the No Response in the “Reengage Applicant” column on the Outreach Log to indicate you will no longer try to mobilize them.
4. Hold the meeting

   2. Take notes on any important details such as a member’s background, skills, and interests. You can put these notes in the “Notes 1-on-1” column of the Outreach Log.
   3. Use the Active Mobilization Requests list to direct new members to where they’re needed most.

   4. Ideally you should come away from this meeting having matched the person to an open position.
   5. Assure you ask the member to send you a signed version of the Data Access Agreement and proof of their membership (have them forward a copy of their latest dues receipt email - you can then screenshot it) at the end of the meeting.
5. Follow up with Data Access Agreement & proof of membership and upload both

   1. Immediately after the meeting ends, send a follow-up email reminding the member to send you the Data Access Agreement and dues receipt. Attach the PDF of the Data Access Agreement to this email. There is an email template at the bottom of this document.

   2. Once they have sent both back to you, upload them to the NDAs and Dues folders, respectively, within the Mobilization Google Drive folder. Follow the naming convention within the folder.

6. Add the new member to Slack

   1. Once you have uploaded both documents above, they are formally an NTC member. Send the member an invite to the NTC Slack.
7. Connect the new member to stewards

   1. Connect the new member to the relevant people in the Slack. This will generally be the steward of the department/commission they are joining, and will most likely be the person under the “Steward” column of the Active Mobilization Requests spreadsheet. The easiest way to do this is to start a Slack dm with you, the new member, and the steward, introducing them to each other.
   2. Ideally you should follow up to assure the person is really active and has been onboarded by the steward. Once they have been, check the Active Mobilization Requests spreadsheet; if only a limited number of the position has been requested, mark that the position has been filled.
   3. Make yourself available to the new member for any questions or concerns they may have. If you haven’t assigned them a specific department/commission/steward, check in with them periodically to keep their engagement, and try to help them find something they can contribute to.

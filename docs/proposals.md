## Proposals

There is no formal process for proposing the creation of new projects or subcommittees within the NTC. The important thing is to put your proposal in writing and submit it to the NTC [Steering Committee (SC)](/docs/steering-committee.md).

You can use previous charters or [proposals](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lLOapm3u-mSDf0ytI-ykdVp2ATBmr_m-) as a template for your own proposal. 

Getting a new proposal written, considered, and accepted is a quesiton of organizing your NTC comrades. It's a good idea to speak with people or teams that might have an interest or a stake in your proposed project, as well as the proposed project's potential steward and subcommittee liaison. 

Once you have a proposal document, you can request that it be considered in at the next SC meeting in [#ask-steering](). SC meetings are open to all members, so you should participate in the meeting in which your proposal is discussed so you can respond to questions or requests for clarification.

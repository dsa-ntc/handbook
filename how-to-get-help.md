# How To Get Help

Getting the help you need to answer a question, address an issue, or get unblocked can be difficult. This page offers some high-level indicators of where to go for certain kinds of help you may need. 

If you need help of a kind that this page does _not_ address, feel free to ask in the [#discussion](https://dsa-ntc.slack.com/channels/discussion) slack channel. Once you get the help you need, please update this page with information on how you resolved your issue by following the step in the [How to Contribute](./contributing.md) article to help others in the future!

## For new joiners
- Introduce yourself in the [#intros](https://dsa-ntc.slack.com/channels/intros) channel!
- For help getting started as a member see the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) article.
- For help understanding certain terms or jargon in the organizational context of the NTC, check the [Glossary](./glossary.md).

## For help understanding NTC...
- For help understanding NTC's organizational structure see the [Organizational Structure](./organizational-structure.md) article.
  - Relevant information about commissions and departments, and the best contacts for these, can be found in here.
  - Note that individual NTC commissions have slack channels whose names are formatted `#c-<commission_name>`. Check [#c-vitalization](https://dsa-ntc.slack.com/channels/c-vitalization) for an example.

## For help with tools
- Check the details in the [Tools List](./tools-list.md) article for simple fixes.
- Ask for help in the [#tools-help](https://dsa-ntc.slack.com/channels/tools-help) slack channel.
- If the tool in question is specific to a certain commission or department, consider asking the relevant steward for help, or requesting help in the commission's / department's slack channel.
- For GitLab specific help, consult the [GitLab](./gitlab.md) article/

## For help regarding a specific issue, commission, or department
- Contact the relevant commission or department steward with questions, or ask for help in the commission's / department's slack channel. Consult [Organizational Structure](./organizational-structure.md) or [Points of Contact](./points-of-contact.md) to find the best person or channel for your question!

## For help with access and security
- Consult the [Access Control Matrix](./access-control-matrix.md).
- For help with information security see the [Security](./Security.md) article. You can also ask for help in [#security](https://dsa-ntc.slack.com/channels/security).

## For emergencies
- Check the [Contingency Plans](./contingency-plans.md) article for specific instructions.
- If no contingency plan that addresses your emergency exists, tag the relevant steward in the relevant commission / department slack channel (for commission / department related issues), or tag steering committee members in the [#discussion](https:dsa-ntc.slack.com/channels/discussion) channel.

# How To Get Help

TODO:
- Link to other parts of the handbook
- Direct links to slack channels?

Members in need of help may find information that answers their questions in the NTC Handbook. 

For help with any tools, ask in the slack channel #tools-help

For help related to a commission or department you are working with, ask the relevant reporting steward.

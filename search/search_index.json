I saw you were interested in getting involved. I'd love to set up a quick meeting to chat about what that could look like. I've got a calendar here, pick a time that works for you and we can get something going. [scheduling link] Looking forward to it! [your name] Post-meeting follow-up email: Hi [their name], It was great speaking with you today! I\u2019ve attached the Data Access Agreement here - please e-sign it and get it back to me when you can. And please send over your most recent dues receipt as well. Once I have those two things, I\u2019ll send you a Slack invite and get you plugged in. Let me know if you have any other questions and I\u2019d be happy to answer them any time. Thanks!

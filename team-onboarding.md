# Team Onboarding

Steward onboarding guide for new team members.

Things you need to do:

1. Add the new member to your slack channel.
2. Make sure the new member has access to [gsuite](./google-groups.md), the [git repo](./gitlab.md), and your [project management solution](./project-management.md).
3. Once the new member has access get them to update the team roster attached to the [Commission and Department Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17pfpMQ6VYcK1TYxAvVAGuWnYu8MYQZ-ruUC7z0VjPig/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Invite the member to the regularly scheduled [sync meeting](./sync-meeting.md). If you normally have a "async sync" meeting consider calling together a special sync meeting so that everyone can introduce themselves and maybe chat a bit.
4. Schedule a 1:1 to introduce yourself to the new member.

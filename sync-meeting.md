# Sync Meeting

A sync meeting is basically a regularly scheduled time to check in with the team. This can be done on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, depending on the needs and cadence of your team.

You can have "async sync" meetings where you create a thread on your team slack channel for people to check in.

It's a lot like a daily stand up, but with looser definitions.

Keep things concrete and focused on actions taken, actions you intend to take. Do not spend this time discussing implementation details, schedule a separate meeting for that (or better yet, hash it out in collaborative documentation).

Do no shirk these because you have failed to get anything done. This is a volunteer organization. All of us have life stuff come up. All of us have fallen behind. You aren't being paid to do this. You're not responsible to your team because of a paycheck. You are responsible to your team because you have made a commitment to them as comrades. The most important thing you can do is be transparent and honest about your needs and boundaries and to communicate clearly with those on your team so that they can adjust their tactics as needed.
